Many thanks to @FreedThx for his report and for providing the output from
that model that enabled the devlopment of this code change.


## [0.4.1] - 2021-04-03

### Fixed

- [essstat.xlsm] Dynamic rescaling of X-axis labels and tickmarks
- [essstat.py] Fix for Issue #3 reported by jan-lukes, AttributeError: 'NoneType'
object has no attribute 'group'. The problem was a code compatibility issue
with newer versions of BeautifulSoup sometime after version 4.8.2. Changing
references to soup.script.text to soup.script.string fixes the problem and
is backwards compatible, at least to beautifulsoup4-4.8.2.


## [0.4.0] - 2020-04-01

### Added

- [essstat.xlsm] Macro-enabled Excel workbook will automatically construct 
a query and execute a web GET operation against the monitoring server using 
the `essstat2.cgi` script. It uses the returned data to plot charts of the
port statistics using dynaic chart ranges.
- [essstat2.cgi] This CGI script is designed to support operation of the essstat.xlsm
Excel workbook. This script will return the average packets per second rate since
the previous record.


## [0.3.2] - 2020-03-30

### Added
 - [essstat-TPLhost.xlsx] Excel workbook for charting statistics accumulated
 in a CSV file. See README.md for information about how to use this workbook
 as well as how to accumulate CSV data with a cron job.
 - [essstat.cgi] A cgi script to use with the Apache httpd to support remote
 query and retrieval from stored CSV files accumulating switch port
 statistics.

### Changed
 - [essstat.py] Modified --1line output to use only numeric codes for
 port state and link status. This is a preferred approach since it will use
 much less disk space when accumulating in a CSV file.


## [0.3.0] - 2020-03-29

### Added
 - [essstat.py] timestamp as first output line (yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS format)

 switch will result in an error status return and output to stderr starting with
 `ERROR:`
